# üöÄ Project Nexus - ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering Documentation

## üåç Overview  
Project Nexus is a knowledge hub documenting key learnings, challenges, and best practices from the ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering program. This repository serves as a reference for both current and future learners, promoting collaboration between frontend and backend engineers.

## üéØ Project Objective  
- Consolidate key learnings from the ProDev Frontend Engineering program.  
- Document major frontend technologies, concepts, challenges, and solutions.  
- Serve as a reference guide for frontend learners.  
- Encourage collaboration between frontend and backend learners.

## üõ† Technologies Covered  
Throughout the program, we explored a wide range of frontend technologies, including:  
- **Next.js** - React-based framework for SSR, SSG, and full-stack capabilities.  
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.  
- **TypeScript** - Enhances JavaScript with static typing.  
- **GraphQL** - Efficient API query language.  
- **RESTful APIs** - Designing, consuming, and integrating APIs.  
- **System Design** - Architectural best practices for scalable applications.  
- **PWA (Progressive Web Apps)** - Building installable web apps with offline capabilities.  

## üìå Key Learnings & Concepts  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Engineering Best Practices**  
- Component-based architecture using **React & Next.js**.  
- Optimizing performance through **SSR, SSG, and ISR**.  
- Scalable styling with **CSS Modules & TailwindCSS**.  
- Handling state management with **useState, useEffect, Context API, and Zustand**.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ API Integration**  
- Fetching data using **GraphQL & REST APIs**.  
- Handling authentication via **JWT & OAuth**.  
- Error handling and security best practices.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ System Design & Optimization**  
- Efficiently structuring frontend applications.  
- Understanding **Microservices & Monoliths** in backend architecture.  
- Code-splitting, lazy loading, and optimizing performance.  

## ‚ö° Challenges & Solutions
